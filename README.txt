  CKRIS: Comparison of Kinetic Realizations of Insulin Signaling

==================================================================

This repository contains the codes used in the comparison of kinetic realizations of insulin signaling (CKRIS) research.

Brännmark (Matlab)
  - Contains the following:
      - Matlab code for approximating Hill-type kinetics with power law
      - Matlab code for simulating the time evolution of species in Brännmark et al's insulin resistance network
      - Graph of the Hill-type kinetics approximated using power law generated using Matlab

Brännmark (Octave)
  - Contains the following:
      - Python code for approximating Hill-type kinetics with power law	(Python was used because I could not install the symbolic package in Octave)
      - Octave code for simulating the time evolution of species in Brännmark et al's insulin resistance network
      - Graph of the Hill-type kinetics approximated using power law generated using Octave
